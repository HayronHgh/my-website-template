# PortfolioKit

A sanitized, file-driven developer portfolio template built with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, runtime Markdown, a protected multi-workspace Admin CMS, and a pixel-night terminal interface.

The goal is to let personal site settings, page images, project cards, project detail pages, and blog posts update from files without rebuilding the app. The built-in authenticated Admin console can create, edit, preview, publish, and recoverably archive Blog posts; site settings and projects remain file-managed. This is useful when the same Docker image keeps running while `content/` is mounted from a persistent volume or updated by a Git sync job.

## Live Example

[Hayron's engineering portfolio](https://www.hayronhgh.com/) is a production deployment of PortfolioKit. It demonstrates the homepage engineering dashboard, project case studies, long-form articles, integrated algorithm practice, responsive mobile layouts, and the protected file-backed Admin workflow running with Docker.

The live site uses private runtime content and branding. This repository keeps sanitized starter content so the template can be reused without publishing deployment data.

## Architecture

```txt

  page.tsx                     Home, runtime project highlights
  projects/page.tsx            Project index
  projects/[slug]/page.tsx     Project detail article

  blog/[...slug]/page.tsx      Direct article route
  leetcode/page.tsx            Algorithm practice index
  research/                    Ranked research index and detail pages
  admin/                       Protected editorial console and login
  api/admin/                   Auth, session, article, and preview APIs

content/
  site/
    site.json                 Runtime profile, navigation, resume, and page images
    assets/                   Personal runtime images served through /site/assets
  projects/
    project-a/
      meta.json                Project card metadata
      main.md                  Long-form project detail
  blog/

      main.md                  Blog frontmatter + markdown body
  research/
    experiment-name/
      main.md                  Research frontmatter + markdown body
      experiment.json          Allowed numeric controls (optional)
      experiment.mjs           Trusted JavaScript experiment (optional)

lib/
  admin/                       JWT, RBAC, request policy, and article writes
  projects/meta.ts             Runtime project metadata loader
  projects/details.ts          Project markdown loader
  projects/relations.ts        Blog/project relation matching
  content/validation.ts        Zod content schema validation
  content/cache.ts             mtime-based runtime file cache
  site/settings.ts             Runtime site settings loader
  site/assets.ts               Runtime site asset path guard
  blog/posts.ts                Runtime blog loader
  blog/markdown.ts             Markdown to HTML pipeline
```

Project pages are split into two files:

```txt
content/projects/project-a/meta.json
content/projects/project-a/main.md
```

Blog articles use frontmatter:

```md
---
title: Template Architecture
date: 2026-01-05
summary: How the runtime content system is organized.
tags:
  - Architecture
relatedProjects:
  - project-a
published: true
---
```

Project-to-blog relations work in two ways:

- Explicit: blog `relatedProjects` points to a project slug.
- Tag-based: project `relatedTags` overlaps with blog `tags`.

The protected Admin workspace manages Articles, Research, LeetCode records, Projects, and Resume data while keeping each domain in its own file-backed content model. Its API/RBAC contract, environment variables, persistent-volume requirements, backups, archive recovery, and security boundaries are documented in:

- [Admin CMS operations](docs/admin-cms-operations.md)
- [Admin CMS architecture and threat model](docs/admin-cms-architecture.md)

## Validation And CI

Local full check:

```bash
pnpm check
```

Equivalent individual commands:

```bash
pnpm audit:prod
pnpm typecheck
pnpm validate:content
pnpm test:run
pnpm lint
pnpm build
```

CI runs the same quality gates before the Docker image build:

```txt
production audit: No known vulnerabilities found
typecheck:      pass
content schema: pass
unit tests:     pass
lint:           pass
production build: pass
docker build:   pass
```

The full development-tree audit still reports a dev-only `ESLint → minimatch 3 → brace-expansion` advisory. Forcing brace-expansion v5 breaks that legacy consumer's API, so the enforced gate is `pnpm audit:prod` while the repository waits for the upstream minimatch 3 consumer to update.

Docker build is enforced by GitHub Actions and can also be run locally with Docker installed:

```bash
docker build -t portfolio-template:ci .
```

`validate:content` checks site settings, runtime site image paths, project `meta.json`, project detail markdown, blog frontmatter, related project references, date format, enum fields, slug consistency, and unsafe markdown URLs.

## Benchmark

Runtime content behavior:

- Layout, navigation, footer, homepage copy, resume sections, and page images read `content/site/site.json` on request.
- `/projects` reads `content/projects/*/meta.json` on request.
- `/projects/[slug]` reads `content/projects/[slug]/main.md` on request.
- `/blog` reads `content/blog/**/main.md` on request.
- `/research` reads ranked entries from `content/research/**/main.md` on request.
- `dynamic = "force-dynamic"` and `revalidate = 0` are used on runtime content routes.
- File reads and markdown rendering use an in-memory mtime cache keyed by file path, `mtimeMs`, and file size.
- Mounted content changes are picked up on the next request after the file timestamp or size changes.
- Runtime site image URLs include a file mtime/size version so replacing an image with the same filename invalidates the Next image cache.

## Screenshots

Add screenshots after customizing the template:

```txt
docs/screenshots/
  home.png
  projects.png
  project-detail.png
  blog.png
  mobile.png
```

Recommended capture checklist:

- Desktop home view
- Projects index
- Project detail with related articles
- Blog article with related projects
- Mobile navigation and single-column content

## Why This Design

This template uses local files instead of a database because the main content workflow is portfolio publishing, not high-frequency multi-user editing.

Key reasons:

- Project cards need structured metadata.
- Project details need long-form Markdown.
- Blog posts need tags, dates, frontmatter, and direct routes.
- Docker deployments can update content by mounting folders.
- Runtime content keeps a small mtime cache so repeated reads avoid unnecessary markdown conversion.
- Git-based content history remains simple and reviewable.

The result is a small content system with a protected editorial console, while avoiding a database or external CMS service.

## Tradeoff

This design intentionally accepts a few constraints:

- The built-in Admin workspace edits Articles, Research, LeetCode, Projects, and Resume data. Site settings remain file/Git managed; project and resume writes are administrator-only and project creation has no delete or version-history workflow.
- Research experiments execute only pre-authored `experiment.mjs` files and accept numeric parameters declared by `experiment.json`. Public pages expose controls and designed results, never a code editor. The production Docker image enables this trusted-code player; non-Docker environments can keep `RESEARCH_RUNNER_ENABLED=false`. It is not an OS sandbox, so only administrator-authored scripts should be deployed.
- CMS writes require one writable Node.js instance and a persistent filesystem shared by live Blog content and `content/.trash`; multi-writer and serverless ephemeral deployments are unsupported.
- Runtime file reads plus mtime cache are simpler than a database, but not ideal for very large content collections.
- Markdown raw HTML is disabled and rendered HTML is passed through `rehype-sanitize`.
- Personal page images can live under `content/site/assets`; add your own optimized WebP/AVIF assets when ready.
- Site, project, and blog content schemas are validated by `pnpm validate:content`, but the app still normalizes runtime content defensively.

## Getting Started

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open:

```txt
http://localhost:3000
```

To enable `/admin`, generate the JWT secret and password hash, configure `.env.local`, then follow the [Admin CMS quick start](docs/admin-cms-operations.md#本機快速啟動). The placeholders in `.env.example` are intentionally unusable.

## Editing Projects

Create or edit:

```txt
content/projects/project-a/meta.json
content/projects/project-a/main.md
```

Minimum `meta.json`:

```json
{
  "slug": "project-a",
  "title": "Project A",
  "category": "Product System",
  "summary": "Short summary.",
  "description": "Longer card description.",
  "tech": ["Next.js", "TypeScript"],
  "cover": "generated:project-a",
  "coverPosition": "center center",
  "accent": "cyan",
  "detailsUrl": "/projects/project-a",
  "group": "featured",
  "published": true,
  "relatedTags": ["Architecture", "Case Study"]
}
```

## Editing Blog Posts

Create or edit:

```txt
content/blog/my-article/main.md
```

Use frontmatter:

```md
---
title: My Article
date: 2026-01-01
summary: Short article summary.
tags:
  - Architecture
relatedProjects:
  - project-a
published: true
featuredRank: 0
---
```

## Editing Site Settings

Create or edit:

```txt
content/site/site.json
content/site/assets/
```

Use `site.json` for profile text, navigation, contact links, resume content, homepage copy, and page image mapping. Public root paths such as `/globe.svg` can reference files in `public/`. Relative image paths such as `hero/home.webp` are served from `content/site/assets/hero/home.webp` through `/site/assets/hero/home.webp`.

Relative site image paths are constrained to `content/site/assets` and must use an allowed image extension: `avif`, `gif`, `jpg`, `jpeg`, `png`, `svg`, or `webp`.

## Docker Runtime Content

Build the image:

```bash
docker build -t portfolio-kit .
```

The following is a public, read-only content deployment; the `:ro` Blog mount cannot support Admin writes:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 \
  -e ADMIN_CMS_WRITE_ENABLED=false \
  -v ./content/site:/app/content/site:ro \
  -v ./content/blog:/app/content/blog:ro \
  -v ./content/projects:/app/content/projects:ro \
  portfolio-kit
```

With this setup, editing mounted content on the host does not require rebuilding the Docker image. To enable Admin writes, mount the whole `/app/content` tree as one writable persistent volume, keep `blog` and `.trash/blog` on the same filesystem, and grant container UID/GID `1001:1001` access. See [Docker and persistent-volume operations](docs/admin-cms-operations.md#docker-與-persistent-volume).

## Standalone Dist Without Content

Build and package the app shell:

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm package:dist
```

The generated `dist/portfolio-template-standalone` and zip intentionally do not
include `content/`. Deploy the app shell once, then update site data by replacing
or mounting content on the server. Mounting `content/site`, `content/blog`, and
`content/projects` separately is a read-only topology and must use
`ADMIN_CMS_WRITE_ENABLED=false`. A CMS writer must instead mount the whole
`content` tree at `/app/content` as one writable persistent filesystem so Blog
and `.trash/blog` share the same rename boundary. This prevents a packaged app
update from accidentally overwriting live content.

## Security Notes

- Markdown raw HTML is disabled.
- Rendered markdown is sanitized with `rehype-sanitize`.
- Markdown links allow `http`, `https`, `mailto`, `tel`, safe relative paths, and hash links.
- Markdown images allow `http`, `https`, safe relative paths, and root-relative public paths.
- Blog and project asset routes constrain paths to their content directories.
- Site image assets served from `/site/assets` are constrained to `content/site/assets`.
- Production dependency audit is enforced by CI with `pnpm audit:prod`.
- The built-in Admin uses JWT/HttpOnly cookies, a configured user whitelist, admin/editor RBAC, Origin validation, strict schemas, slug path guards, revision conflicts, atomic writes, and recoverable archives.
- Secrets and password hashes must be injected at runtime and must never be committed. Review the full [threat model](docs/admin-cms-architecture.md#威脅模型) before enabling writes.

## Admin CMS Verification Status

CI defines a non-root named-volume write smoke, but the production persistent-volume deployment has not yet been exercised locally through login, write, archive, restart, and persistence. The Admin responsive implementation has also not yet been verified with the Codex in-app Browser at target viewports. These are explicit pre-production checks, not completed claims; see [known verification status](docs/admin-cms-operations.md#尚未完成的實機驗證).

## Commit Convention

Use conventional commits:

```txt
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

Common types:

```txt
feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore, build, ci, revert
```
